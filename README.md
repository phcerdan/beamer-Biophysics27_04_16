Beamer using mtheme. U. Leipzig talk for soft matter department

If using modern texlive (2015) you should be able to install fonts: Fira, FiraSans, etc.

If using texlive from ubuntu 14.04, install the fonts at the same time than the beamer theme using the following pull request (Nov2015). Maybe in the future is already merged in master.

git clone https://github.com/benjamin-weiss/mtheme.git -b font-theme
